# Notion Widgets
I'm trying to implement HTML and other code embeds into Notion and this is my last resort.
---
I don't claim any of this code to be original or my own. I'm just trying to make my pages look pretty.
---
Steps:
1. Create a new file.
2. Customize the widget and copy the HTML code. Paste it into the new file and name property (with `.html` extension).
3. Publish and commit changes. The widget link will be `repositoryURL/filename.html`.
4. Paste link in Notion.
